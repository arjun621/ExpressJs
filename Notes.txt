Node is a runtime environment 

ExpressJS is a framework which is used to handle requests and generates corresponding 
response. It is also used to create APIs, routes etc.
Express takes care of all the things from the incoming request to outgoing response.

Middleware - Middleware is used between, when server accepted user request and routing.
             Without Middleware request directly goes to route from server.

__dirname - dirname shows the path from starting to current folder 
            example - /home/user1/Arjun/ExpressJs/Practice


res.render("index") - is used to render index.ejs or any page.

:username - this colon will create dynamic route.

req.params.anything - req.params is used for the value which is after colon(:)

mongoose is used to communicate between node server and mongodb server.

Every mongoose code is asynchronous and we have to use async await for that.
